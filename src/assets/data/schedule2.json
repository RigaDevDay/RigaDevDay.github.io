However, there is no object-relational impedence mismatch since documents fit the concept of object-orientation much better. This removes a lot of JPA pain, which makes database interactions fun again. On a practical level we take a look at the available annotations and how to map your objects as well as how to easily query data in MongoDB. Next we discuss some patterns on how to solve common requirements, such as the proper use of generics, auto-increments, and the encryption of sensitive data. The talk concludes with some tips and lessons we've learned from using Morphia in production for three years.",

When I was introduced to the team, they had hacked something on a Bamboo server, based on custom Python scripts that uploaded the binaries to a Hockeykit, completely decoupled from the Maven build and the Nexus repository. The they decided to switch to Gradle... In this presentation, I will describe how I migrated from this situation to the following: * a full-fledged Jenkins server provisioned with Puppet * provisioning of the Android SDK manager * provisioning of Gradle * updates of the platforms, extras and repositories behind the entreprise proxy * creation of Gradle jobs managing Hockeykit files creation, upload of the whole outputs to Nexus and tagging Git for releases builds",

We can write beautiful and highly expressive tests because of its DSL and all the power that Groovy provides us.In this talk you'll learn the basics of Spock and you'll see how easily you can test a Java application.
