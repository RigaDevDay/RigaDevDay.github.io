When I was introduced to the team, they had hacked something on a Bamboo server, based on custom Python scripts that uploaded the binaries to a Hockeykit, completely decoupled from the Maven build and the Nexus repository. The they decided to switch to Gradle... In this presentation, I will describe how I migrated from this situation to the following: * a full-fledged Jenkins server provisioned with Puppet * provisioning of the Android SDK manager * provisioning of Gradle * updates of the platforms, extras and repositories behind the entreprise proxy * creation of Gradle jobs managing Hockeykit files creation, upload of the whole outputs to Nexus and tagging Git for releases builds",
