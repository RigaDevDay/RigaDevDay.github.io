What happens when implementations go astray or dogmatically follow half-knowledge, misconceptions,
or conveniently cheap shortcuts? Learn about recurring pitfalls, their origins, their impacts,
and most importantly their remedies in an entertaining fashion.
However bad you thought your project was, you’ve seen nothing yet...
<br/><br/>
Turning the standard best-practice/how-to presentation format on its head,
this presentation will look at some real-life OBIEE implementations and where it all went wrong.
We’ll look at the worst, the weirdest, the most absurd and the wackiest ways the Oracle BI tool is abused:
<ul>
    <li>How did projects get to these points?</li>
    <li>What were the original misconceptions?</li>
    <li>How to counter these misconceptions?</li>
    <li>Why are "it works" and "it fulfills the requirements" not only not enough but rather dangerous pitfalls?</li>
    <li>Can I actually jeopardize the future of my BI system by choosing a cheap quick and dirty approach?</li>
    <li>Is it ever OK to simply execute without comprehension?</li>
</ul>
This session will give attendees a deeper understanding of the impact seemingly innocuous design and implementation
decisions can have on the stability and success of an entire BI system.
An end-to-end view of the stack will be taken, covering areas including logical modelling, analysis design,
and architectural topics. The importance of a holistic view and an appreciation of alternatives will be emphasized
as well as the need to understand, comprehend and reflect on the implications of a “best practice” being
followed as well as the technology stack simply being misunderstood.`,

There have been many attempts over the years and all have their flaws.
One of the major problems is that many solutions require learning a new language and skillset,
while that is often – if not always – the most valuable asset.
With Xamarin, it becomes possible to re-use C# skills to build iOS and Android applications and
on top of that, re-use much of the code base for both Windows 8 and Windows Phone 8 apps.
In this introduction session, we will take a look at how we can build apps using C#
which run on all platforms. We will also take a look at the different code-sharing strategies
which we have available, including PCLs, shared code and more.
With Xamarin, development can be done from Visual Studio as well as from Xamarin Studio;
we’ll show the different options here as well.
After this session, you’ll have a good overview of what Xamarin can help you with and
also what are the different building blocks of the platform.

is wide-spread across projects around the globe. Millions of analyses have been created,
deployed and run billions of times. The actual lifecycle of an Oracle BI query from its inception through
to the effective delivery of results may therefor be regarded as a given commodity not requiring a closer look.
Few people have regarded an OBI query from the point of view "How does it get constructed? How does it get translated between the different architectural components and the RPD layers? How, through what and where does its lifecycle get influenced? Where can we as users/developers/administrators actively intervene with its makeup and structure? Why do we genuinely have to have an understanding of the subtleties of the life-cycle in order to create successful BI solutions?"
<br><br>
The purpose of this presentation is to serve as an introductory session for beginners while at
the same serving as a reflective discussion of a topic regarded as "god-given / it just IS" by the wider
population of users (including intermediates). Theoretical examination of the possible steps and paths the query
lifecycle can take is depicted with simple but speaking examples.
The impact of factors like basic analysis construction in Answers, advanced SQL clauses, caching,
business model peculiarities like multi-star queries, snowflaking and LTS modelling as well as physical
layer settings like call interfaces, data source parametrization or inclusion of hints in the RPD are to be showcased.`,

While everyone else is talking about “continuous delivery” do your deployments feel more like an extreme game of Jenga, tittering on the brink of disaster and a nightmare to reconstruct? It doesn’t have to be like this. Launched only two years ago, Docker has revolutionised application deployment. Using this open-source project, applications are packaged into lightweight containers, that are hardware and platform agnostic. Containers move from the local developer machine to a production server and then the cloud without modification! So, how do you migrate a traditional three-tier Java web application to use Docker? Let’s use a sample web application, designed for hosting on a single server, convert it to use Docker and deploy to a cloud platform. We’ll break out the application and component services into individual containers that can be ran and scaled independently. Showing you how to utilise existing pre-built images for rapid development, build custom container images for your application and move seamlessly between deployment platforms, enabling us to use “cloud” to accelerate application development. We will configure automatic build, test and deploy pipelines for continuous deployment and auto-scaling to handle unpredictable application traffic with ease. If you’re an application developer who’s exhausted from battling deployment issues, maintaining ”special” production servers and lives in fear of being on ”pager duty”, come and learn how you can use Docker to banish “works on my machine” syndrome. This talk is for developers who’ve heard about this “Docker thing” and want to see a practical example of converting a traditional monolithic web application to use Docker containers deployed to a scalable cloud platform.",

In this session we are going to talk a bit why JetBrains sees the potential in Kotlin comparing to other JVM languages. Then we’ll see how certain language constructs can be used to make Android more enjoyable. Also we’ll look at a DSL for type-safe dynamic layouts and a simple extension plugin that helps to avoid writing ‘findViewById()’ all the time.",

This talk is intended for Java developers who wants to hear and see how you can develop Java microservices that runs in containers.
<br><br>
This talk uses Apache Camel as the Java library to build microservice architectured applications.
At first we introduce you to Apache Camel and show how you can easily get started with Camel on your computer, and build a microservice application that runs on CDI and Spring-Boot.
<br><br>
The second part of this talk is about running Camel (or any Java project) on Docker and Kubernetes.
<br><br>
We start covering the basic concepts you as a Java developer must understand about Kubernetes. Then we show how to migrate Java projects to build as Docker images and deployable on Kubernetes, with help from fabric8 Maven tooling.
<br><br>
You will also hear about how to make your microservices scalable and distributed by leveraging the facilities that Kubernetes provides for truly distributed services with load balancing and location independence.
<br><br>
You will also see how to manage your container using the Kubernetes CLI and the fabric8 web console.
<br><br>
At the end we have a bit of fun with scaling up and down your Camel application to see how resilient the application is, when we kill containers.
