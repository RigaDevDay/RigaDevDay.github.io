          "description": "Ansible is a great way to automate every piece of your infrastructure. We will start off with a quick introduction what it can do for you and why it is both simple and powerful: Deployments, configuration management, and orchestration are just three areas where Ansible shines, all without requiring a central server or an agent on your instance. Then we will progress on how to automate your AWS setup. Ansible can configure your network, databases, caches, instances, or firewall rules in an automated and documented fashion. So you will never have to ask the question again: 'Why did I add this specific security rule a year ago? Does anyone still remember? Do we still need it?!' In this workshop you'll get the chance to set up a complete AWS infrastructure to make you productive right from the start. And we'll discuss some common problems and issues to be aware of.",
