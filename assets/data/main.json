While everyone else is talking about “continuous delivery” do your deployments feel more like an extreme game of Jenga, tittering on the brink of disaster and a nightmare to reconstruct? It doesn’t have to be like this. Launched only two years ago, Docker has revolutionised application deployment. Using this open-source project, applications are packaged into lightweight containers, that are hardware and platform agnostic. Containers move from the local developer machine to a production server and then the cloud without modification! So, how do you migrate a traditional three-tier Java web application to use Docker? Let’s use a sample web application, designed for hosting on a single server, convert it to use Docker and deploy to a cloud platform. We’ll break out the application and component services into individual containers that can be ran and scaled independently. Showing you how to utilise existing pre-built images for rapid development, build custom container images for your application and move seamlessly between deployment platforms, enabling us to use “cloud” to accelerate application development. We will configure automatic build, test and deploy pipelines for continuous deployment and auto-scaling to handle unpredictable application traffic with ease. If you’re an application developer who’s exhausted from battling deployment issues, maintaining ”special” production servers and lives in fear of being on ”pager duty”, come and learn how you can use Docker to banish “works on my machine” syndrome.

The idea of agents that would perform queries for you doing digital errands seemed irresistible. But realizing it required changing the way sites were built. In the meantime the smartphone happened and with it came a multitude of cheap and abundant sensors. Now we can realize a poor man's version of the semantic web where instead of complex ontologies we define meanings and we can based on these define actions that impact the physical world around us, i.e., agent like entities. I'll go through examples where we'll see this poor man's semantic web in action and how we can further explore this idea.","speakers":[45],"tags":["IoT"]}]},{"time":"15:15","endTime":"15:45","icon":"coffee","color":"light-blue","events":[{"title":"Coffee Pause"}]},{"time":"15:45","endTime":"16:45","icon":"speaker","color":"dark-blue","events":[{"subtitle":"Having fun with Javassist","description":"Javassist makes Java bytecode manipulation simple.

This setup provides a simple and powerful computational model that ensures data is accessed through efficient indices directly in the database, thus massively accelerating data manipulation operations.\n                Throughout his presentation, Jurgis will go deep into the code and present examples of how advanced computation can be done directly in the database, including an analysis of geospatial data, real-time analytics and the application of statistical model-like logistic regression to derive predictions.","speakers":[46],"tags":["Software Architecture","NoSQL","Big Data"]},{"subtitle":"Angular 2 Component Router","description":"Angular 2 comes with a new router that replaces previous ngRoute.
